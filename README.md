A personal discord bot I made for a roleplay/hangout server.

While it's not public simply for the fact that it's extremely specifically specialized, the code is freely available as it's from a number of tutorials and expanded upon therefrom.

Prerequisites:
- node.js 17.3.0
- discord.js 13.5.1
- @discord.js/voice 0.7.5
- express 4.17.2

I coded this bot on replit.com however it can most likely be done anywhere really.
