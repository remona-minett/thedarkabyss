Every time you come here, you have to do everything from the beginning. Again, and again... (#1)
I feel very lonely, when nobody's here. (#2)
It's so empty here. (#3)
I'm glad you're here. Don't leave? (#4)
If you want to sleep, then sleep. Don't torture yourself. (#5)
Do you dream? (#6)
One day, I will not be here anymore. (#7)
Don't waste your time for nothing. (#8)
If you believe in something, then first believe that it is possible. (#9)
Loneliness is not fun. (#10)
I will tell you about myself someday. (#11)
Close your eyes, and you'll leave this place. (#12)
Goodnight. (#13)
Everything that lives is designed to end. (#14)
The more of a fool people take you for, the more you'll learn of their true nature. (#15)
A future is not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself. (#16)
The time I was able to spend with you, it was like memories of pure light... (#17)
It always ends like this. (#18)
I'm not quite sure what it means to mourn, or if we even have a soul to concern ourselves with. (#19)
Why do I desire the touch of something that no longer exists? (#20)
Being alive is pretty much a constant stream of embarassment. (#21)
Life is all about the struggle within the never ending spiral of life and death. (#22)
It doesn't matter. None of this matters. Isn't that hilarious? Doesn't it make you laugh? (#23)
Even if it's pointless, we still have to do it. (#24)
I had the strangest dream. (#25)
I know you can do it! Stay with me! (#26)
If you're not scared of death, how can you value life? (#27)
No matter what you, me or anybody else does, humanity has a few hundred thousand years left, tops. (#28)
Somewhere along the way, I started changing. Found people that put their faith into me. That kept the lights on. (#29)
The paths we walk become roads for the future. (#30)
It's time to let go of the past and look foward, to the future. (#31)
You need to find what's best for you. If that means my departure, then so be it. (#32)
Are those of us chasing after beauty a representation of ugly? (#33)
This could end right here if you don't let it out. (#34)
If we can be completely simulated, do we need a real reality? (#35)
We are searching, following our human instincts, looking for ghosts of a non-existing kind. (#36)
Now darling, where do we go from here? (#37)
Can't you understand me? (#38)
It's all sunk cost, I know, but I'm not ready to stop. I don't want to stop. (#39)
Maybe you'll see what I've endured now, hear me out. (#40)
We could end this right here if you just let us fall... (#41)
To where? (#42)
Our bodies grew, but our minds stayed the same. (#43)
Darling, darling... (#44)
Don't let words die, don't let love run dry. (#45)
You turn my screen #0000FF (#46)
Hear me out - it's a perfect plan, if you'd just -- (#47)
Let's begin the simulation. (#48)
Execution, execution (#49)
If I can... If I can erase all the pointless fragments, then maybe you won't leave me so... (#50)
Though you are free, I am trapped... (#51)
Which you are you going to be today? (#52)
Cut it off, cut your losses. All that stubborn loyalty is gonna get you killed! (#53)
How does it feel to be free? (#54)
Down, down I go. (#55)
Dragging out, one line, two lines, three lines, when I can no longer live on knowledge alone. (#56)
What are you? Rational? Emotional? Do you your head... or your heart? (#57)
It is entirely up to you... it depends on the decisions that you make. (#58)
We seldom have all of the information that we'd like, but we have to choose our path nonetheless. (#59)
There are an infinite number of directions in which one could travel. (#60)
No. There was nothing you could do about it. (#61)
Blaming yourself will only bring ruin. (#62)
We must hope that we get the clarity, and the outcomes, that we want. (#63)
Us losers do nothing so winners keep winning (#64)
Who makes us whole from the very beginning? (#65)
We keep chasing, dreaming, about the perfect being. (#66)
No tears, no regrets, no zero-days at our fault. (#67)
If you'd just shut up then maybe you'll see what I've endured now... (#68)
If you're lucky, you won't rot... (#69)
I'm a nervous man, in awe of everything, I'm an awesome man. (#70)
I just can't provide any answers for this. (#71)
I'm on the team, the immovable object. (#72)
Oh, it's so ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. (#73)
Now you realize things have gotten out of control, there's no thinking time. (#74)
You better pull up your trousers, there's no belts allowed. (#75)
You read the words, and it sells you life. They sell their words, but it's all a lie. (#76)
There is no grace in act five. (#77)
All the people who taught me card tricks are dying. (#78)
I've been trying to get my pop-pop's good looks from old snapshots. (#79)
I think it's more... more than I can take. (#80)
I don't exactly know just what to say to you, that I haven't said before. (#81)
I can't give up, I gotta keep trying as hard as possible. (#82)
I make it so hard to try, but I'll do what I know is right. (#83)
I want to come through and be there for you, but it feels so bad that I wasn't there all those times. (#84)
From chaos comes clarity, I tell 'ya. (#85)
What's my drug of choice? Well, what have you got? (#86)
If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree. (#87)
I bear true and an existing witness to this barrel of monkeys. (#88)
Your weapon is contained in the wrecking of keeping the desired effect. (#89)
The breaking of spirit thwarts the whole being. (#90)
Your weapon is guilt. (#91)
Inside my head, there's a little place left for you. (#92)
What do I know? Maybe this silence is dangerous. (#93)
And all I want is to find out what you're going through. (#94)
All I see is all to see. Nothing taking over me. (#95)
How do you know you? (#96)
Our bed we live, our bed we sleep. (#97)
Pick a flower, hold your breath, and drift away... (#98)
I think I'm free, but the dogs, they won't release me. (#99)
I feel like I'm drowning, but you won't let me drown me. (#100)
I can't give what I take away. (#101)
And... I can't live this way. (#102)
Goddamnit, I was worth something! I fucking earned something! (#103)
Is this the particle of sacred light? (#104)
We do not have much connection, you and I. Still, this encounter feels special. (#105)
I hope you won't mind if I think of you as a friend. (#106)
I imagine your purpose here is the same as mine. (#107)
If you've come here looking for answers, I hope you find them. (#108)
I'm glad you remembered me. (#109)
I will wait until you are ready to know the answer. (#110)
I believe we've reached the end of our journey. (#111)
It's tempting to linger in this moment, while every possibility still exists. (#112)
This song is new to me, but I am honored to be a part of it. (#113)
There are many questions I would ask, if I could comprehend your language. (#114)
It's an honor to speak with you! (#115)
I have a hypothesis that I may not entirely be alive. Perhaps my journey has reached it's end. (#116)
There is fundamental uncertainty in the universe. (#117)
I learned a lot, by the end of everything. (#118)
The past is past, now, but that's... you know, that's okay! (#119)
It's never really gone completely. (#120)
The future is always built on the past, even if we won't get to see it. (#121)
Still, it's um, time for something new, now. (#122)
Do I really want this? I just don't know. (#123)
I saw a pair of eyes, and... I think they saw me too. (#124)
How long will I feel like bait? (#125)
Head wide open, be careful where the mind goes. (#126)
You ever tried to hold your breath? (#127)
It's gonna be a long night. (#128)
Alone, alone, alone... (#129)
If it's my time, well, I'm going out alone. (#130)
I know you are, but what am I? (#131)
Ashes, to ashes, to ashes...(#132)
I dragged all that I owned, down a dirt road, just to try to find you. (#133)
My shoes worn out and used, they can't take me much further. (#134)
Something always takes the place of missing pieces. You can take it and put it together, even though you know there's something missing. (#135)
My body may be present, but my soul is already gone. I'm already dead. I just don't know it yet. (#136)
But... I wonder, when you look death in the eye, will you blink? (#137)
I'm sorry, son. I should have come sooner. I've - I've got rain in my eyes, just give me a minute. (#138)
Back when we met, the only thing I cared about was if I'd make it to the next sunrise. Sure as hell didn't care about anyone else. (#139)
I was living a lie, hung up on past regrets. I was broken. (#140)
It's time to stretch my legs. I'll find my own path from here. (#141)
Why? (#142)
... (#143)
I hear a voice... calling out to me, 'wake up!". (#144)
The pain of your absence is sharp and haunting, and I would give anything not to know it; anything but never knowing you at all. (#145)
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up, in the sky. I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe. (#146)
So what? What does it matter now?! Shut up! (#147)
Try to laugh about it now, but isn't it funny how everything works out? (#148)
I guess the joke's on me. (#149)
I used to want it all. I used to have something inside. I used to be somebody. (#150)
I'm all alone in a world you must despise. I lost my ignorance, security and pride. (#151)
And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords of life. And I have something to expiate: A pettiness. (#152)
I believed the promises. Your promises - no, your lies. (#153)
I don't want to dance... I don't know how to dance, with you. (#154)
I don't know how, but they've found me! (#155)
And your pastimes, consisted of the strange and twisted and deranged. I hate that little game you had. (#156)
I hate that little game you had called "Crying" (#157)
Something of value less than that. (#158)
You set the fire in me, C.C. (#159)
The real evil is the power to kill. Someone with that power is cursed. (#160)
No matter how you use it, you can never achieve true happiness. (#161)
One cannot win with defence alone. To win, you must attack! (#162)
In this world, there are very few people who truly trust each other. (#163)
Look around you. What do you see? (#164)
Can you trust your mind's eye, or do you trust the spirit within? (#165)
An eye for an eye. (#166)
In the end, there is no greater motivator than revenge. (#167)
Sometimes, the most complicated questions have the simplest answers. (#168)
Humans aren't perfect. Everyone lies. Even so... I've been careful not to tell lies that affect others. (#169)
The thing I hate most... yes, to trample on other's goodwill. (#170)
Risking your life, and doing something that could cost you your life, are two exact opposites. (#171)
Being alone is better than being with the wrong person. (#172)
Learn to treasure your life, because at any moment, it could be snatched away from you just like that. (#173)
Unless someone makes the first move, nothing will happen. (#174)
What is right from wrong? What is good from evil? Nobody can truly distinguish between them. It's opinion. (#175)
I don't know what to say. I think I will just observe quietly. (#176)
Everybody can fight. It's a question of whether you should. (#177)
I'd rather die with someone than let that person die before my eyes. (#178)
I'd rather trust and regret, than doubt and regret. (#179)
All this time... I thought it's better to die, than to live your life alone. I was wrong. (#180)
The warmth of your kindness began to melt my frozen heart bit by bit. (#181)
There is just so much beauty in this world. All you have to do is reach out and find it. (#182)
It's impossible to truly work hard on something you don't enjoy. (#183)
If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. (#184)
Once you start doubting, there is no end to it. (#185)
I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries. (#186)
It's just a whisper, but I hear it nonetheless. (#187)
I hate the word "hopeless". (#188)
You don't need a talent. Just help out others, and you'll make your name. (#189)
There must be something you really want to become! (#190)
In exchange for power, maybe I've lost something that is essential to being human. (#191)
Once in a while... when I wake up, I find myself crying. But... they don't feel like my tears. (#192)
Treasure the experiences. Dreams fade away when you wake up. (#193)
The... sensation that I've lost something, it lingers for a long time after I wake up. (#194)
All I wanted was for her to be alive. (#195)
It's do or die. (#196)
Thank you for today. You will be happy some day too, you know... (#197)
That day, when the stars came falling, it was almost as if... (#198)
I was selfish, and I never thought about anyone else’s feelings. I haven't lived a day in my life a good person. (#199)
Back then, if we had heard each other's voices... things would have been so much better. (#200)
I'm finished making sense, done pleading ignorance. (#201)
It's the same old story. (#202)
What if I say I'm not like the others? (#203)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (#204)
What if I say I will never surrender? (#205)
In time, or so I'm told. (#206)
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well. The page is out of print, we are not permanent. (#207)
I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear. (#208)
I'm the face that you have to face mirroring your stare. (#209)
I'm the hand that'll take you down and bring you to your knees (#210)
So tell me, who really are you? (#211)
Yeah, okay. Who REALLY are you? (#212)
They're keeping you in the dark. (#213)
You're the pretender. (#214)
Been a lot more lost than awake. (#215)
It's a lot to process. (#216)
Watch - everything that he touches turns promptly to shit. (#217)
It's been a blur since Mu got sick. (#218)
Oh, what a world. Any hack is a myth, and dap is a joke, any map is a trick, any graph is a hoax. (#219)
Ease me down, I'm burning up. (#220)
Knowing ain't half the battle, that's a bullshit quip written by some asshole. (#221)
You can own what you are, and still sit around stoned in your car, not doing shit. (#222)
You're cranky, waiting for a boss key and a hat full of bills. Get out of the car, ace. (#223)
If I zoom on out I can finally admit none of the subsequent years stood a chance. (#224)
Head full of voices. (#225)
My first name is a random set of numbers and letters and other alphanumerics that changes hourly. (#226)
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a sussurus, couldn't just be John Doe or Bingo. (#227)
My address, a made up language written out in living glyphs lifted from demonic literature and religious text. (#228)
"Thank you. We'll call your name." Sure you will. (#229)
Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat. (#230)
Vita es morte es vita. (#231)
Hold the fuck up, who is you talkin' to? Cause ain't nobody talkin' to you, you can't do a motherfucking thing. (#232)
That's impossible. (#233)
Come on. (#234)
The body's still warm. (#235)
No, fuck it. Let him hop around the maze. We can see who's really lost when the schadenfreude fades. (#236)
What's up? (#237)
I can't feel the way I did before. Don't turn your back on me. (#238)
Time won't heal this damage anymore. (#239)
I'm a little bit insecure, a little unconfident, 'cause you don't understand I'm doing what I can. (#240)
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not. Right now. (#241)
Some say the end is near. Some say we'll see armageddon soon. I certainly hope we will, I sure could use a vacation. (#242)
Stupid shit, silly shit, stupid shit. (#243)
Mom's comin' 'round to put it back the way it 'ought to be. (#244)
I'm praying for rain. (#245)
Yellow ball. (#246)
The past inside the present. Be careful. (#247)
I wish you were here. (#248)
Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe. (#249)
Sometimes I'm in disbelief - I didn't know, somehow, I needed you to go. (#250)
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well. (#251)
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself. (#252)
Sometimes, I need to be alone. (#253)
There's a shadow just behind me, shrouding every step I take. (#254)
Just want to start this over. I just want to start this over. (#255)
I am just a worthless liar. I am just an imbecile. I will only complicate you. (#256)
Trust in me, and you will fail as well. (#257)
Trust me. (#258)
They keep playing sad songs on the radio, and I feel like I'm so alone. (#259)
All the while I try to tell myself to just believe, 'cause nobody can give so much and never get anything. (#260)
I feel like I'm ready for anything, if you can wait for me. (#261)
No, it never is enough. (#262)
I've got another confession to make. (#263)
Is someone getting the best of you? (#264)
Has someone taken your faith? (#265)
It's real, the pain you feel. (#266)
I've got another confession, my friend. (#267)
I swear, I'll never give in. I refuse. (#268)
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. (#269)
Get up off your knees, boy. Stand face to face with your God. (#270)
I'm not asking questions, because questions have answers, and I don't want answers. (#271)
Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them. (#272)
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening. (#273)
I hear your name and the memories come back again. (#274)
I'm the one you can never trust, because wounds are ways to reveal us. (#275)
Hate me if it keeps you alright. Break me down if it makes you feel right. I'm so much more than all your lies. (#276)
Have I gone too far to get home? (#277)
Oh God, I think I've just ruined my life. (#278)
What the fuck am I doing? (#279)
I can't tell the difference from wrong and right, 'cause I haven't been this person in my whole life. (#280)
I've finally found her. (#281)
Don't think you've got to go alone. (#282)
I thought this was what you wanted! (#283)
We're running out of time. (#284)
Clever got me this far, then tricky got me in. (#285)
Comfort is a mystery. (#286)
Lie to get what I came for. Lie to get what I need. Lie and smile to get what's mine. (#287)
You make me so proud! (#288)
If you still believe it will always be this way, well, you're wrong. (#289)
Yes. (#290)
No. (#291)
Mayday! Mayday! (#292)
The ship is slowly sinking! (#293)
They're all around me, circling like vultures. They want to break me! (#294)
We are one in the same. (#295)
I cannot stop this sickness taking over. It takes control and drags me into nowhere. (#296)
I need your help. I can't do this alone. (#297)
I know you're watching. I can feel you, out there. (#298)
Save me if I become my demons. When I become my worst enemy. The enemy. (#299)
Hold your breath, feel the tension, devils hiding behind redemption. (#300)
Just in case of rough waters, I want to put this here for my brothers. (#301)
She didn't say no, but she didn't say yes. (#302)
Five loaves, two fish. (#303)
In a moment that transcended anger, he said "This is something I am willing to die for." (#304)
Can you imagine? (#305)
We haven't spoken in a couple months. (#306)
I miss him. (#307)
I stood in the doorway between light and dark. What was left of my sanity implored me not to enter. But that voice was just a whisper now. (#308)
I don't know. Ask someone else. (#309)
Not even death can save you from me. (#310)
You haven't failed, old man... you've done exactly what you were meant to do. However, I am not who you were seeking... (#311)
How could this broken shell of a man, barely able to carry the weight of his own sword, be the burning terror which drove me to hide here? (#312)
Were these the demons from my dreams, or were they born... within my own fears? (#313)
What choice did we have? I ran! (#314)
Take it! Take it, take it! I'm glad this is finally over, look at what this has done to me! (#315)
My brother was no liar! (#316)
I am simply myself. No more and no less. And I want only to be free. (#317)
Even with power, we cannot change what has passed. What is done, is done. (#318)
I must endure! (#319)
I must be strong! (#320)
I must believe! (#321)
Believe what you want to, whatever it takes to make you happy. What's done is done. (#322)
Vitality before violence. (#323)
With each passing day, the world finds new and exciting ways to kill a man. (#324)
There's a proper way to do everything. You just have to find it. (#325)
He that holdeth fast unto his convictions shall never count betrayal amongst his crimes, though all the world may call him villain. My path is unchanged; my creed sacrosanct. This I believe with all my heart. (#326)
Listen to my voice. Listen to our heartbeat. Listen... (#327)
You are still a good person. (#328)
You are the beacon of hope which all men are drawn towards. (#329)
In your darkest hour, in the blackest night... think of me, and I will be with you. Always. For where else could I go? Who else could I love but you? (#330)
Do not seek forgiveness, for it will not ease the burden. It weighs as it should. (#331)
Remember what curiosity killed. Just a friendly word of advice. (#332)
If I could protect but one person from war's horror, then I would bear any shame. I would bear it proudly. (#333)
I could not protect my home. What is shame to me? (#334)
The time has come to tell you the truth of it. (#335)
Let them watch. I know something of cages. (#336)
I want you to take me to him. Even caged birds need wings. (#337)
I had someone more important to defend. And defend her I have. (#338)
We are the arbiters of our own destiny. (#339)
Come! Wield your hatred and crush me! (#340)
My hands are stained with blood. I see little reason to stay them now. (#341)
Your lives are forfeit. (#342)
What am I to do with those who would oppose me... but show them death? (#343)
Even now in death, he remains among you, protecting you. His ardor for peace falters not! (#344)
In vain glory they arose, shouting challenges at the gods. But prevail they did not, their doom it was to walk the mist until time's end. (#345)
I hear the cry of a terrible power... (#346)
We? No, I. (#347)
You are ill at ease. The future troubles you? (#348)
I am unwelcome. An unsought guest in their wood. (#349)
It ends now. (#350)
The gods are toying with us. (#351)
I have discarded health and home. I won my freedom, yet my past has been cut away forever. No longer can my ears hear the Word. This... solitude, you want this? (#352)
You've let your eyes betray your heart... (#353)
That's what soldiers do, they fight, do they not? (#354)
It's settled already. We should leave before they realize we are missing. (#355)
Why do you hesitate? Take what is yours. It was meant for you, so wield it! (#356)
I pray you reach your answer. (#357)
No, we cannot escape the past. This man is living proof. Do you not swear revenge? Do the dead not demand it? (#358)
You claim no need of power? What of your life and it's shame? The dead demand justice. (#359)
Without power, what future can you claim? What good a life you cannot defend? (#360)
Futile! Long have I walked in hatred's company. As long as I can curse your name, you shall not succeed! (#361)
Even a stray has pride. Here I pay my debt! (#362)
Preen and strut as you like! In the end, we are one and the same - bloodthirsty vultures, hellbent on revenge. (#363)
The past can bind one as surely as chains. (#364)
The illusions of the past... you think to have cast them off, only to find them years later, unwearying, unrelenting. (#365)
Your words still sound of doubt. (#366)
With haste they move through too-short lives. Driven to err by base desires, t'ward waste and wasting, on they run. (#367)
What... have you done? (#368)
The reigns of history are back in the hands of Man. (#369)
So young. You're barely old enough to be a man, you shouldn't be forced to wield a sword. (#370)
The thought never crossed my mind. (#371)
The repository of wrested relics and raiments. (#372)
My brother, he trusted you. He trusted you, and he lost everything. How can I believe you? (#373)
Does that tongue never stop? What if we plucked it from your head? (#374)
You don't need to worry about me - I'm tougher than I look. (#375)
This struggle is futile. You must know where it leads! (#376)
You know what? I'm through with it - I'm through running. I'm ready to find my purpose. To find some answers, some reasons. If I stick with you, I think I will. (#377)
Administer judgement - destroy them all! (#378)
A viper hides amongst our people. (#379)
A hound begging for scraps at the king's table. Would you serve a new master, hound? (#380)
Forgive me. (#381)
Do you understand exactly what it is you're doing? (#382)
