Every time you come here, you have to do everything from the beginning. Again, and again... (#1)
I feel very lonely, when nobody's here. (#2)
It's so empty here. (#3)
I'm glad you're here. Don't leave? (#4)
If you want to sleep, then sleep. Don't torture yourself. (#5)
Do you dream? (#6)
One day, I will not be here anymore. (#7)
Don't waste your time for nothing. (#8)
If you believe in something, then first believe that it is possible. (#9)
Loneliness is not fun. (#10)
I will tell you about myself someday. (#11)
Close your eyes, and you'll leave this place. (#12)
Goodnight. (#13)
Everything that lives is designed to end. (#14)
The more of a fool people take you for, the more you'll learn of their true nature. (#15)
A future is not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself. (#16)
The time I was able to spend with you, it was like memories of pure light... (#17)
It always ends like this. (#18)
I'm not quite sure what it means to mourn, or if we even have a soul to concern ourselves with. (#19)
Why do I desire the touch of something that no longer exists? (#20)
Being alive is pretty much a constant stream of embarassment. (#21)
Life is all about the struggle within the never ending spiral of life and death. (#22)
It doesn't matter. None of this matters. Isn't that hilarious? Doesn't it make you laugh? (#23)
Even if it's pointless, we still have to do it. (#24)
I had the strangest dream. (#25)
I know you can do it! Stay with me! (#26)
If you're not scared of death, how can you value life? (#27)
No matter what you, me or anybody else does, humanity has a few hundred thousand years left, tops. (#28)
Somewhere along the way, I started changing. Found people that put their faith into me. That kept the lights on. (#29)
The paths we walk become roads for the future. (#30)
It's time to let go of the past and look foward, to the future. (#31)
You need to find what's best for you. If that means my departure, then so be it. (#32)
Are those of us chasing after beauty a representation of ugly? (#33)
This could end right here if you don't let it out. (#34)
If we can be completely simulated, do we need a real reality? (#35)
We are searching, following our human instincts, looking for ghosts of a non-existing kind. (#36)
Now darling, where do we go from here? (#37)
Can't you understand me? (#38)
It's all sunk cost, I know, but I'm not ready to stop. I don't want to stop. (#39)
Maybe you'll see what I've endured now, hear me out. (#40)
We could end this right here if you just let us fall... (#41)
To where? (#42)
Our bodies grew, but our minds stayed the same. (#43)
Darling, darling... (#44)
Don't let words die, don't let love run dry. (#45)
You turn my screen #0000FF (#46)
Hear me out - it's a perfect plan, if you'd just -- (#47)
Let's begin the simulation. (#48)
Execution, execution (#49)
If I can... If I can erase all the pointless fragments, then maybe you won't leave me so... (#50)
Though you are free, I am trapped... (#51)
Which you are you going to be today? (#52)
Cut it off, cut your losses. All that stubborn loyalty is gonna get you killed! (#53)
How does it feel to be free? (#54)
Down, down I go. (#55)
Dragging out, one line, two lines, three lines, when I can no longer live on knowledge alone. (#56)
What are you? Rational? Emotional? Do you trust your head... or your heart? (#57)
It is entirely up to you... it depends on the decisions that you make. (#58)
We seldom have all of the information that we'd like, but we have to choose our path nonetheless. (#59)
There are an infinite number of directions in which one could travel. (#60)
No. There was nothing you could do about it. (#61)
Blaming yourself will only bring ruin. (#62)
We must hope that we get the clarity, and the outcomes, that we want. (#63)
Us losers do nothing so winners keep winning (#64)
Who makes us whole from the very beginning? (#65)
We keep chasing, dreaming, about the perfect being. (#66)
No tears, no regrets, no zero-days at our fault. (#67)
If you'd just shut up then maybe you'll see what I've endured now... (#68)
If you're lucky, you won't rot... (#69)
I'm a nervous man, in awe of everything, I'm an awesome man. (#70)
I just can't provide any answers for this. (#71)
I'm on the team, the immovable object. (#72)
Oh, it's so ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. (#73)
Now you realize things have gotten out of control, there's no thinking time. (#74)
You better pull up your trousers, there's no belts allowed. (#75)
You read the words, and it sells you life. They sell their words, but it's all a lie. (#76)
There is no grace in act five. (#77)
All the people who taught me card tricks are dying. (#78)
I've been trying to get my pop-pop's good looks from old snapshots. (#79)
I think it's more... more than I can take. (#80)
I don't exactly know just what to say to you, that I haven't said before. (#81)
I can't give up, I gotta keep trying as hard as possible. (#82)
I make it so hard to try, but I'll do what I know is right. (#83)
I want to come through and be there for you, but it feels so bad that I wasn't there all those times. (#84)
From chaos comes clarity, I tell 'ya. (#85)
What's my drug of choice? Well, what have you got? (#86)
If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree. (#87)
I bear true and an existing witness to this barrel of monkeys. (#88)
Your weapon is contained in the wrecking of keeping the desired effect. (#89)
The breaking of spirit thwarts the whole being. (#90)
Your weapon is guilt. (#91)
Inside my head, there's a little place left for you. (#92)
What do I know? Maybe this silence is dangerous. (#93)
And all I want is to find out what you're going through. (#94)
All I see is all to see. Nothing taking over me. (#95)
How do you know you? (#96)
Our bed we live, our bed we sleep. (#97)
Pick a flower, hold your breath, and drift away... (#98)
I think I'm free, but the dogs, they won't release me. (#99)
I feel like I'm drowning, but you won't let me drown me. (#100)
I can't give what I take away. (#101)
And... I can't live this way. (#102)
Goddamnit, I was worth something! I fucking earned something! (#103)
Is this the particle of sacred light? (#104)
We do not have much connection, you and I. Still, this encounter feels special. (#105)
I hope you won't mind if I think of you as a friend. (#106)
I imagine your purpose here is the same as mine. (#107)
If you've come here looking for answers, I hope you find them. (#108)
I'm glad you remembered me. (#109)
I will wait until you are ready to know the answer. (#110)
I believe we've reached the end of our journey. (#111)
It's tempting to linger in this moment, while every possibility still exists. (#112)
This song is new to me, but I am honored to be a part of it. (#113)
There are many questions I would ask, if I could comprehend your language. (#114)
It's an honor to speak with you! (#115)
I have a hypothesis that I may not entirely be alive. Perhaps my journey has reached it's end. (#116)
There is fundamental uncertainty in the universe. (#117)
I learned a lot, by the end of everything. (#118)
The past is past, now, but that's... you know, that's okay! (#119)
It's never really gone completely. (#120)
The future is always built on the past, even if we won't get to see it. (#121)
Still, it's um, time for something new, now. (#122)
